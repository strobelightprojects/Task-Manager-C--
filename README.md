# Overview
I created this project to test my ability to use CPP. This project is a task manager that allows the user to add remove and view tasks that they have created. It uses a menu loop to do these things. I wanted to be able to save and load tasks from a file but was not able to do so to expand the useability of the project. Overall my purpose was to test what I could create in CPP and to learn more by completing a project. 

# Development Environment

*C++ 20 *Visual Studio Code *Git/Github * clang version 14.0.3 * C++ STL Libary 

# Useful Websites

- [W3Schools website used to learn. ](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/) 
- [geeksforgeeks website used to learn about STL library](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/the-c-standard-template-library-stl/)

# Future Work

- Add the ability to save and load tasks
- Add the option for repeatable tasks like daily 
- Add an option to alert for tasks based on time
- Improve by adding descriptions into the program like a welcome message that explains how to use the task manager
